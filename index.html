            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Adolf Hitler was born on April 20, 1889, in Braunau am Inn, Austria-Hungary (now Austria). He rose to prominence as the leader of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi Party) and became Chancellor of Germany in 1933.</p>
            <p>His early life was marked by struggles and a failed attempt to enter art school. In World War I, Hitler served as a soldier and was wounded twice. His post-war years saw him become involved in politics and, eventually, in the 1920s, the Nazi Party.</p>

            <p>Hitler's rise to power began in the early 1920s when he joined the Nazi Party. Through powerful speeches, propaganda, and exploiting economic and social instability in Germany after World War I, Hitler gained a large following. In 1933, he was appointed Chancellor and quickly moved to consolidate power by eliminating political opposition and establishing a totalitarian regime.</p>

            <p>The Holocaust was the systematic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million Jews by the Nazi regime. In addition to the Jewish population, millions of others—including Romani people, disabled individuals, Polish people, Slavs, LGBTQ+ individuals, and political opponents—were also targeted and killed. The Holocaust stands as one of the darkest chapters in human history, reminding us of the dangers of hate, racism, and totalitarianism.</p>
